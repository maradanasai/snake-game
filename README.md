This Snake AI using Hamiltonian paths is inspired by https://johnflux.com/2015/05/02/nokia-6110-part-3-algorithms/

Note: currently it's a command line game where 0's in the board are empty spaces, 1's are snake body and the number will be food. I'm planning to make a gui version with levels (that will include walls in the border as well as within the board depends on levels)

Thanks, John for sharing such a beautiful article :)
